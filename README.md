# My Personal Blog Site :)

Hi all! Welcome in the GitHub repository of my personal blog site. This is the fourth version of my blog.

I have developed the first version almost 15 years ago moving my first steps into web development in **PHP**. After few years I moved to **ASP.NET** because along with my professional skills I have improved my knowledge of .NET Framework, so using ASP.NET was the natural result of this path. 

Then, after additional few years, web has become more complex, with an increasing number of features required to be developed to move with the times (RSS feed, analytics integration, comment platform integration, and so on), so I started using a CMS, choosing **Orchard CMS** (simply because it was looking a promising project and was developed in .NET).

This fourth version has embraced a completely different approach. Instead of moving to a new complex and feature rich CMS, I have decided to use a static website generator called [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). If you don't know it, take a look, I think it deserves it!
